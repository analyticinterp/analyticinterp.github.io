[TO BE WRITTEN]

some facts about DL are clear in practice but really hard to show mathematically!

one of these is: why does optimization work at all?

- we can make models
- loss surfaces; study of convex loss surfaces
- NTK (+ overparam more generally)

okay, what do we know about optimization in the real world?

- EoS
- central flows?
- maybe I can get Jeremy to write this one.

can we do better than GD?

- optimizers, Muon, etc.
